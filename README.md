# Zentra Core - Version 0.9.6 (OOP Stabilization)
Language: [English](README.md) | [Italiano](README_ITA.md) | [Español](README_ESP.md)

# 🤖 Zentra Core
**Your Personal Offline AI Assistant (Private, Modular, Powerful)**

---

## 🚀 Overview
**Zentra Core** is a local-first AI assistant platform that runs entirely on your machine.
It combines local LLMs, voice interaction, system automation, and a modular plugin architecture to create a fully customizable AI companion.

Now fully migrated to a **stable Object-Oriented (OOP) architecture**, Zentra 0.9.6 offers unprecedented reliability and performance. Powered by **LiteLLM**, it supports Ollama, KoboldCpp, and major cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq) with native streaming.

---

## ✨ Key Features (v0.9.6)
* 🏗️ **Stable OOP Core** — Fully refactored for professional-grade stability and modularity.
* 🧠 **Multi-Cloud Streaming** — Native support for Groq, OpenAI, and Gemini with real-time "typewriter" effect.
* 🔄 **F7 Live-Sync** — Change settings in the configuration panel and see them applied instantly without restarting.
* 🔌 **Standalone Plugins** — Every plugin is now an independent module that can run even without the core system.
* 🎙️ **Multilingual Voice Interaction** — Dynamic TTS/STT with automatic language selection (EN/IT).
* ⚙️ **System Control** — Execute commands, open apps, manage files, and control hardware.
* 💾 **Persistent Memory** — SQLite-based long-term memory with shared context across WebUI and Terminal.
* 🖥️ **Refined Logging** — Isolated technical debug windows and clean chat history.
* 🔗 **WebUI Bridge** — Full compatibility with Open WebUI and local streaming APIs.

## 🧠 How It Works
Zentra Core is built around a modular architecture:
* **Core** → AI routing, processing, execution
* **Plugins** → Actions and capabilities (system, web, media, etc.)
* **Memory** → Identity and persistent storage
* **UI** → User interaction layer
* **Bridge** → External integrations and APIs

The AI generates structured commands that are interpreted and executed through the plugin system.
